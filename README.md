# CAASR: A Real-World Animation Super-Resolution Benchmark with Color Degradation and Multi-Scale Multi-Frequency Alignment  
CAASR:  
CAASR is a benchmark designed to push the boundaries of super-resolution for animation. We provide a modern dataset and a robust training pipeline tailored for both 2D and 3D animated content.

:innocent: ADASR Dataset：The full training dataset, including both 2D and 3D animation sequences, is available here: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1wLWdVZdZhgL2OO2ADaWlLw (password: a135)

:hearts: Fast Inference：Evaluation data can be downloaded from: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1eJf7BE3VUb-3LebW_M5weQ (password: a135)

:clubs: Pretrain Weight：Pretrained models for 2D and 3D animation are provided here: https://pan.baidu.com/s/15eUi6gR8jhOxj3Q9OQDpYQ (password: a135). Pretrained weights for comparison methods can be found at: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1vOxc1WJBe0TjKwrwexp9EQ (password: a135)

:tophat: Train：  
We recommend adjusting degradation settings and selecting model scales based on your specific use case and content domain.

:beer: Test：  
We use [PYIQA](https://github.com/chaofengc/IQA-PyTorch) for all perceptual quality evaluation. Default settings are used for 2D content. For 3D animations, we fine-tune MANIQA and TReS, the corresponding weights can be downloaded here: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1r071-EV3nqnrdmkoXgI8DQ (password: a135)
